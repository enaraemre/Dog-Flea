Dog Flea Model in Csharp

Simulate the evolution of dog-flea model,

assuming that

•there aren=20 fleas in the system

•the initial state of the system isX(0) = (20,0).1)

For iterations i=1,2,...20 print out:i,ri,X(i),wherer i is the random number on the basis of which you have made thetransition from the previous stateX(i−1).

2)Determine the average value of iterations that system needs to come back to the initial stateX(0)

(perform20simulations).
